# PiePHP - The instant gratification framework

[PiePHP](http://piephp.com/) is a rapid development framework for PHP which significantly speeds web application development.  It includes a code generator, a database generator, a documentation helper, and a functional testing suite.

## What's in the pie?

- A simple yet solid **Model View Controller** architecture
- Essential **rapid application development** features

## What sets PiePHP apart?

- **Speed**  
  PiePHP has the fastest page rendering time of any major PHP framework.

- **Persistent page**  
  The PiePHP JavaScript library can AJAXify your links and forms, so the page shell doesn't need to re-render as users browse. That means you can put media players or chat widgets or whatever you want into your page, and they won't need to stop.

- **Environments**  
  PiePHP supports development, test, staging and production environments to make your development environment flexible and your live site secure.

- **Auto-refresh**  
  When you save changes in your IDE, your PiePHP development environment can cause your pages to refresh in every browser window. What better way to optimize the change & verify cycle?

- **Error editing**  
  In a development environment, errors are shown as editable code blocks. So you can fix the error and move on quickly without even leaving the page.
